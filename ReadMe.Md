The follow technologies are used like most VML projects:

* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* LoDash
* Node.js and NPM
* SCSS
* Grunt


## Assumptions 

* The project sturcture is similar to what you will encounter with a VML project. 
* Bootstrap is already included on the page so all classes, features and styling available Bootstrap is avaliable to be used. 
* jQuery and LoDash are already installed. 


## Don'ts

* Use inline styling
* Include any Javascript in the HTML file


## Instructions 

1. Install project dependencies through the Command Line
2. Make sure the `app.scss` file is compiling into the `APP` directory. 
3. Add HTML markup for a button and text input field
4. Style the button to match creative using `SCSS`. 
5. Style the input field using Bootstrap classes.
6. Add functionally to the button so that when it's clicked a modal will pop up and display text that as been enter into the input box. 


## Extra Challenge

*	Uncommit the include list in the HTML file 
*	Modifty the Click function to filter the list based on text entered into the input field.


## Bonus


* Use a responsive container in your HTML
* Create the arrow using CSS shapes. 
* Initize Javascript with out using $(document).ready()
* Change button color and size based media queries 
* Use BEM CSS class snytax in your HTML
