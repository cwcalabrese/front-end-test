The follow technologies are used like most VML projects:

* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* SCSS
* Grunt

## Assumptions 


* The project sturcture is similar to what you will encounter with a VML project. 
* Bootstrap is already included on the page so all classes, features and styling available Bootstrap is avaliable to be used. 
* jQuery is also installed because of Bootstrap dependenecy on jQuery.


## Instructions 

1. Make sure the `app.scss` file is compiling into the `APP` directory. 
2. Style the button to match creative using `SCSS`. 
3. Add functionally to the button so that when it's clicked a modal will pop up. 


## Don'ts

* Use inline styling
* Include any Javascript in the HTML file


## Bonus

* Create the arrow using CSS shapes. 
* Not using document ready
